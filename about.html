        <p class="col-md-8">I am a fourth year student at Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa graduating in May 2016 with a B.A. in Computer Science and Theatre & Dance. I grew up in Cedar Rapids, Iowa with a younger brother, older sister, and various animals ranging from
          fish to salamanders to turtles, to guinea pigs, to dogs. I enjoy being outdoors, and while the Iowa prairies will always be my home, I do love the mountains. I am also a very amateur photographer, but I thought I'd share some of my better pictures
          here as well.
          <br>
          <br>As evidenced by my double major, my design interests lie both in the theatrical world, and in the software world. While they may seem like disparate areas, For me, these design areas are equally concerned with telling stories to an audience.

      <h2>Theater</h2>

      <p>
        <br>In theater, my primary focus is lighting design. I became interested in technical theater after running the light board for a children's theater production in high school. Once I got to Grinnell, I started designing the the lights for student
        productions, department plays, and dance shows. In addition to lighting design, I have also worked on projection, sound, costume, and set design.

      <h2>User Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Similar to how it is a designers job to aid the audience in getting a full experience of a performance, the UX designer connects users to functionality. I'm interested in creating interfaces that are easy-to-use, accessible for all, effective, and fun.
        UX design brings together my computer science background with my design experience and my empathetic self.
